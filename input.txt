(moody rock music). Sitting in yesterday, watching it slip away today. Isolation. Fading like photographs, reminding us nothing ever lasts. Desolation. I look up to the sky but the sun never shines. I'm waiting. There's a thousand different shades of darkness. Coloring our faith. The past is dead, the future's haunted. What happened to today, today. Promises built to crash. Walking on dreams and broken glass. Hell's creation. Try to find my escape. Somewhere where I can hide away. Desperation. I look up to the sky but the sun never shines. I'm waiting, yeah. There's a thousand different shades of darkness. Coloring our faith. The past is dead, the future's haunted. What happened to today, today. There's a thousand different shades of darkness. Coloring our faith. The past is dead, the future's haunted. What happened to today, today. There's a thousand different shades of darkness. Coloring our faith. The past is dead, the future's haunted. What happened to today, today.
